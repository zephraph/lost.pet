# Lost Pet Project

The goal of this project is to aid people in finding their lost pet projects in a sustainable way.

## Principles

- Losing a pet is a traumatic event. We should treat those impacted with respect and compassion.
- Help should never be paywalled. Features that are sold to assist with sustainability should only offer convienence.
- Complexity counters sustainability. We should do what we're able to ensure the project can continue to run with as little effort and overhead as possible.
